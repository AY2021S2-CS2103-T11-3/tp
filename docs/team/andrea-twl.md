## Project: TutorPets

TutorsPet is a desktop app designed for private tutors in Singapore to manage studentsâ€™ information, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TutorsPet helps improve the efficiency and effectiveness of student management by categorizing relevant contact information and keeping track of both lesson schedules and important dates.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to Sort the list panel by name, school, subject and lesson. Pull Requests: [\#81](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/81), [\#102](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/102)
  * What it does: Allows the user to sort their contact list in the list panel according to their preferred criteria
  * Justification: This feature greatly improves readability of the product by making it easier for users to manage their list of students by organising it, so students of the same or similar details will be grouped together in the list panel.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this feature required a deep understanding of observable lists and their implementations in the Model Manager, because it requires both filtering and sorting of the persons list. 
 
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to increase and decrease the levels of all the students at once. Pull Requests: [\#124](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/124), [\#131](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/131)
  * What it does: allows the user to increase or decrease all their students levels by one, unless the students are excluded
  * Justification: This feature allows the mass updating of the students' levels at the start of the school year, and the ability to undo the update if it was accidental.
  * Highlights: This implementation requires the transformation of the observable list in Model Manager using unary functions in order to exclude some students but upgrade the rest.
