## Project: TutorPets

TutorsPet is a desktop app designed for private tutors in Singapore to manage studentsâ€™ information, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TutorsPet helps improve the efficiency and effectiveness of student management by categorizing relevant contact information and keeping track of both lesson schedules and important dates.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view the contact details and lesson schedule on the details panel.
  * What it does: allows the user to view the student contact details and lesson schedule by keying in the detail command.
  * Justification: This feature improves usability and readability of the product significantly because a user can view a well formatted student details clearly without feeling overwhelmed by massive amount of information.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing UI and possibly UI in the future. It requires an in-depth analysis of design patterns. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing UI.
 
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to Search the student contact by specified school.
  * What it does: allows the user to search the student contact details and display students that have the same school as the specified school.
  * Justification: This feature improves navigability of the product significantly because a user can search for a student using another particular instead of their name.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing Search command. It requires an in-depth analysis of the Search command structure.
