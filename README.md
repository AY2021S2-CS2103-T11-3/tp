* This is TutorsPet**.<br>
  Target user: 
  * Tuition teachers
  
  Usage: 
  * Manage and categorise contacts of students and their guardians
  
  Goal:
  *  To improve efficiency and reduce confusion when tutors are tracking students' information


* The project evolves the `AddressBook-Level3` (`AB3` for short) into a more powerful or more optimized contact management app.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  

* It is named `TutorsPet` because it aims to facilitate a tutor's management of students' information.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.

This project is based on `AB3` project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
